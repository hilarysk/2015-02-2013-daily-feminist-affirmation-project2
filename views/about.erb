<p>"Daily Feminist Affirmation" started with a note I angrily typed into my phone one day after suffering major <a href="/keyword?keyword=feminist+fatigue">feminist fatigue</a>. For whatever reason, I'd been persistently pestered that day by negative images of women and feminism - whether more so than usual, or whether I was just more sensitve that day, I'm not sure - and I pictured an app that would remind me of how passionate, dedicated and impactful women can be, and that would serve as a sort of daily "pick-me-up" when I found myself sliding into the feminist-defender doldrums.</p>
<!-- <p>I'm sure you've been there, too - the point when, tired of hitting your feminist head over and over against the patriarchal wall without seeming to make a dent, you contemplate just giving up.</p>
<p>Trust me. I feel you.</p>
<p>Times like that, I find perspective to be key. Reading about women like <a href="/keyword?keyword=Ella+Baker">Ella Baker</a>, who fought tirelessly for her rights in the mid-20th century, reinvigorates my belief in the tangible possibility for change. We ARE making progress, even if it feels agonizingly slow.</p>
<p>Don't give up. Keep fighting the good fight. Because it's totally worth it.</p>
<p>As Ms. Baker once said, "This may only be a dream of mine, but I think it can be made real."</p> -->

<p>A second major component of "Daily Feminist Affirmation" was fueled by my desire to make my intersectional feminism an <em>action</em>, not just a <em>concept</em>. As a white, educated, skinny, middle-class feminist, I wanted to more deeply examine my <a href="/keyword?keyword=privilege">privilege</a> and educate myself about non-white feminists who've enriched our lives in countless ways and made possible so many of the freedoms we take for granted today. Given this, "Daily Feminist Affirmation" strives to include women of color whose efforts and history may have gone unnoticed by the feminist mainstream, women like <a href="/keyword?keyword=Ella+Baker">Ms. Baker</a>, <a href="/keyword?keyword=Ida+B.+Wells">Ida B. Wells</a>, <a href="/keyword?keyword=Kimberlé+Crenshaw">Kimberlé Crenshaw</a> and so many more.</p>
<p>The one takeaway from this site should be that, cheesy as it sounds, we're all in this together, and while we have a long way to go, we shouldn't lose sight of how far we've already come - and, on the flip side, no matter how knowledgeable we might think we are when it comes to feminism, there's always more to learn.</p> -->
